<h1 style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Hospital Beds in United States</h1>
<h2 style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Data for 2015-2020</h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">This visualisation is designed to demonstrate the number of hospital beds available in the United States.
    The data was retrieved from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ikiulian/global-hospital-beds-capacity-for-covid19?select=hospital_beds_per_wdi_v1.csv">Kaggle</a>
    by Igor Kiulian, Arthur Kiulian, Augaly S. Kiedi and Kristoffer Jan Zieba. The objective of this dataset is to demonstrate the hospital capacity during of each state.
    This visualisation is critical in understanding the reliability of each state in reacting to a high impact pandemic (such as COVID-19). The data retrieved is a combination from multiple
    sources.

<h2>Number of Beds Dot Density Map</h2>
<body style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
    <p>
    The first visualisation is a <b>dot density map</b>, demonstrating the number of beds per 1,000 inhabitants for each state. 
    A <b>drop-down selection</b> can be used to view each year's performance. The purpose of this visualisation is to show the <b>comparison of each states</b> performance in the number of beds provided.
    This is an important information, as it can easily address any potential flaws in the health system of USA. If a certain state lacks hospital beds it can impact the ability to react to a health crisis causing strain in
    the hospitals and can lead to an influx of patients without the necessary resource. This visualisation can also help understand the <b>capacity</b> of each state, for the health experts to appropriately assign and relocate patients.
    To view, please select year with the drop-down box.

<h2>Bed Type Usage Bar Chart</h2>
<p>The second visualisation is a interactive <b>bar chart</b> showing each bed types available in the US. This demonstrates the popularity of each bed type, and can create a visual comparison of each type.
    Use the drop-down box to select the year to visualise. From the bar chart we can see that <b>acute beds</b> are the <b>most common</b> type of bed throughout all the years. This is not suprising as, the patients for acute beds are the
    more common type of cases.

              </tr>
          </table>
          Each type serves a purpose for different situations, this visualisation is design to understand which bed type is in more desperate need for funding.

<h2>States With The Most Beds of a Type</h2>
<h3>Top 20 States Bubble Plot</h3>
<p>The last visualisation shows a <b>bubble plot</b> of the top 20 states with the highest beds per 1,000 inhabitants in every year. The visualisation includes multiple interactive features including,
    a drop-down box for the type of bed to view, zooming in and out to view the data and also mouse hover for highlighting and tooltip.

        <p>
            For each type of bed, it has been found that <b>Iowa has the most acute</b> beds in 2018, <b>Montana has the most ICU and Psychiatric</b> beds in 2018.
            This indicates that the states would be more prepared for an influx of patients, which is a vital data set in understanding crisis management for pandemics and flu season.
